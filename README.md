## Repositories:

 - ### [FrontEnd](https://github.com/tomorrowbiostasis/Biostasis-FrontEnd) 📱
    The frontend repository (MobileApp) developed using the **React Native** framework, which provides an intuitive user interface and efficient performance on both Android and iOS platforms. Also, **Swift** was used to develop the application logic on IOS. The front-end utilizes **Firebase**, a powerful mobile application development platform, to manage data, cloud messaging and notifications. **Redux** is also integrated into the front-end to efficiently manage React components.

 - ### [BackEnd](https://github.com/tomorrowbiostasis/Biostasis-Backend)  🖥️
    The backend repository utilizes a wide range of technologies to provide a reliable and scalable system. **Node.js** is used as the runtime environment, and **Redis** as a cache memory to enhance the system's performance. **MySQL** is the primary database, and uses **TypeORM** which is a modern and readable way to handle database queries and mapping objects into db records. **NestJS** a progressive Node.js framework. **Docker** enables easy deployment and management of the application.

 - ### [AWS Cloud Services](https://github.com/tomorrowbiostasis/Biostasis-Cloud-infrastructure) ☁️
